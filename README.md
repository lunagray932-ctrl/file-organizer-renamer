## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 **Two Powerful Modes**

#### **Mode 1: Find Scattered Files**
Hunt down files across your entire PC and collect them into one organized location.

- 🔍 **Smart Scanning**: Searches Desktop, Downloads, Documents, Videos, Music folders
- 🛡️ **System Protection**: Automatically skips Windows, Program Files, and AppData (safety first!)
- 📦 **Intelligent Organization**: Groups files by type (images/png/, videos/mp4/, etc.)
- 🚀 **Zero Data Loss**: Copies files instead of moving them (originals stay safe)

#### **Mode 2: Organize Folder**
Take any messy folder and transform it into a perfectly organized structure.

- 📂 **Recursive Scanning**: Finds files in nested subfolders
- 🗂️ **Category Folders**: Creates images/, videos/, documents/, etc.
- 🔤 **Sub-Folder Organization**: Further organizes by extension (images/png/, images/jpg/)
- 🧹 **Smart Cleanup**: Removes empty folders after organizing

---

### 💎 **Advanced Features**

#### **🔍 Duplicate Detection**
Never waste space on identical files again.

- **SHA256 Hash Comparison**: Detects true duplicates by analyzing file content (not just names)
- **Visual Review**: Opens duplicate files side-by-side in File Explorer for easy comparison
- **Smart Keep Logic**: Automatically selects the newest file to keep
- **Batch Management**: Delete duplicates in groups or individually
- **Per-Group Selection**: "Select All Here" buttons for quick decisions
- **Recycle Bin Safety**: All deletions go to Recycle Bin (fully reversible)

#### **📅 Date-Based Organization**
Organize files by when they were created or taken.

- **EXIF Date Support**: Reads creation dates from photo metadata (requires Pillow)
- **Multiple Styles**: 
  - `year_month` → 2024/2024-03/
  - `year_only` → 2024/
  - `year_month_simple` → 2024-03/
- **Fallback System**: Uses file modification date if EXIF unavailable

#### **📏 Size Filtering**
Control which files get organized based on size.

- **Minimum Size**: Skip tiny files like thumbnails and cache (default: 50 KB for Find mode)
- **Maximum Size**: Filter out large files (0 = no limit)
- **Smart Defaults**: Find mode filters thumbnails automatically, Organize mode includes all files

#### **⚡ Performance & UX**
Built for speed and user experience.

- **Background Threading**: GUI never freezes, even when processing thousands of files
- **Live Progress Bars**: Visual feedback during long operations (centered, not hidden)
- **Full Screen Results Viewer**: See operations in detail with auto-updating live view
- **Perfect Scroll Behavior**: Scroll position preserved during auto-updates
- **Mousewheel Support**: Natural scrolling throughout the entire interface

#### **🛡️ Safety & Recovery**
Your files are protected at every step.

- **Preview Mode**: See exactly what will happen before committing
- **No Overwrite**: Files are renamed (photo.jpg → photo_1.jpg) instead of replaced
- **Full Undo System**: JSON logs track every operation for complete reversal
- **Operation Logs**: Every action saved in `logs/` folder with timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Failed operations are logged, other files continue processing
